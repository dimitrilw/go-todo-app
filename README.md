# go-todo-app

Quick demo of a classic Todo MVC style app, as requested. Per request, emphasis
is 100% on the backend, with a 100% static index.html frontend.

Backend uses Gin for routing and Gorm for ORM. Database is SQLite, but could be
swapped for anything, so long as the database.go functions are updated to match.
