# go-todo-app

Quick demo of a basic Todo MVC style app. As requested, emphasis
is 100% on the backend, with a 100% static index.html frontend.

Backend uses Gin for routing and Gorm for ORM. Database is SQLite, but could be
swapped for anything, so long as the database.go functions are updated to match.

Priority given to showing separation of concerns.
